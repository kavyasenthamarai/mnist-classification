# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Digit Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for digit classification and to verify the response for scanned handwritten images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

## Neural Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Preprocess the MNIST dataset by scaling the pixel values to the range [0, 1] and converting labels to one-hot encoded format.

### STEP 2:
Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with specified architecture using TensorFlow Keras.

### STEP 3:
Compile the model with categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

### STEP 4:
Train the compiled model on the preprocessed training data for 5 epochs with a batch size of 64.

### STEP 5:
Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test set by plotting training/validation metrics and generating a confusion matrix and classification report. Additionally, make predictions on sample images to demonstrate model inference.
